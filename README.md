# Rock Paper Scissors - DOM Edition 🎮

This is a browser-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The player competes against the computer by clicking buttons to make their selection.

---

## 🛠 Features

- Three interactive buttons for player input (`Rock`, `Paper`, `Scissors`)
- Random computer choice each round
- Real-time score tracking and display
- First to 5 points wins the game
- Cleanly disables buttons once a winner is declared

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use DOM methods like `addEventListener`, `textContent`, and `querySelector`
- How to separate logic into reusable functions
- How to track and update game state through UI interaction
- How to structure a simple project without needing `prompt()` or `console.log()` for user input

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **HTML** — for layout and buttons
- **CSS** — optional styling (add your own flavor!)
- **JavaScript** — for game logic, DOM interaction, and event handling

---

## 🔄 Future Improvements

- Add a **"Restart Game"** button after game over
- Display round history below the score
- Add animations or sound effects for wins/losses
- Style the game for mobile responsiveness

## 📁 How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Click a button to choose your move
3. First to 5 wins the game!
4. Refresh the page to play again (for now)
